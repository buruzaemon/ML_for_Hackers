 Welcome to Jefferson Pilot's
 Gateway to Wealth
 As one of the industry's premier producers, you must continually seek
qualified cutting edge services.
 Financial Profiles	
 Concept	Profiles+ Professional is a personal and business
analysis tool that analyzes a client's insurance, investment and
financial planning goals, to help them see their situation today
compared to their objectives. 	
 Market	Profiles+ Professional is an ideal tool for true financial
planning. It not only provides a thorough analysis, including asset
allocation, but it can calculate tax implications in a client's plan.
Due to its modular format, it can be used for specific planning needs,
as well as more comprehensive planning. 	
 Benefits
This software not only provides exceptional analysis, but excels in
providing simple as well as comprehensive presentation pages. By
uncovering multiple needs, producers sell more products.	 
 Deferral+	
 Concept	An internet-based sales-enabling service, which allows
users to quickly become successful in the deferred compensation (COLI)
market. 	
 Market	Focus on mid-market businesses. In the area of executive
benefits, the mid-market opportunity should be defined by either the
number of employees within a company, or more specifically by the number
of highly compensated executives within a company.	 
 Benefits
A turnkey program that includes qualification of prospect, marketing and
sales support, case design, plan documents and administration. 	
 G.I.F.T.	
 Concept	Global Insurance Funding Transaction (G.I.F.T.) is a
sophisticated premium-financing program that provides an alternative
funding mechanism for life products purchased to offset large estate and
corporate liabilities. 	
 Market	Clients with a high net worth of at least $10 million who have
an insurance need and believe their existing portfolio of investments,
when left unliquidated, will earn more then they will have to pay on
loan interest expenses. 	
 Benefits
G.I.F.T. offers compelling sales solutions, comprehensive supplemental
illustrations and access to a consortium of established banks willing
and able to lend in this market. Loans are available in both U.S.
dollars and Japanese Yen.
